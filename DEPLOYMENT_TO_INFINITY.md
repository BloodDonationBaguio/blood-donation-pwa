# Deployment Guide - Deploy Fixes to Infinity Hosting

## üéØ What We're Deploying

These critical fixes need to be deployed to your production site:

1. ‚úÖ Donor status update transaction fixes
2. ‚úÖ Column name fixes (donation_status ‚Üí status)
3. ‚úÖ Blood type column size fixes
4. ‚úÖ Track page status display fix

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before You Start:

- [ ] All changes tested on localhost and working
- [ ] No errors when updating donor status
- [ ] Track page shows correct status
- [ ] You have FTP/cPanel access to Infinity hosting
- [ ] You have database access (phpMyAdmin)
- [ ] You have a recent backup (if not, create one now!)

---

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Backup Production Database (CRITICAL!) üîí

**DO THIS FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS!**

1. Log into your Infinity hosting cPanel
2. Go to phpMyAdmin
3. Select your database (e.g., `your_db_name`)
4. Click "Export" tab
5. Choose "Quick" export method
6. Format: SQL
7. Click "Go" to download backup
8. **Save the file somewhere safe** (e.g., `backup_before_fixes_2025-10-24.sql`)

**Why?** If something goes wrong, you can restore this backup.

---

### Step 2: Upload Updated PHP Files üì§

Upload these modified files to your Infinity hosting via FTP or File Manager:

#### Core Files to Upload:

1. **`includes/enhanced_donor_management.php`**
   - Location: `/public_html/includes/`
   - Fixed: Column names, transaction handling, blood type validation

2. **`includes/admin_actions.php`**
   - Location: `/public_html/includes/`
   - Fixed: DDL auto-commit issues, audit log table creation

3. **`admin_enhanced_donor_management.php`**
   - Location: `/public_html/`
   - Fixed: Error handling, detailed error messages

4. **`track.php`**
   - Location: `/public_html/`
   - Fixed: Status display bug (approved showing as pending)

#### New Migration Scripts to Upload:

5. **`fix_all_donor_issues.php`** (NEW)
   - Location: `/public_html/`
   - Purpose: One-click fix for all database issues

6. **`fix_donations_table_column.php`** (NEW)
   - Location: `/public_html/`
   - Purpose: Specific fix for column name issues

7. **`fix_blood_type_column.php`** (NEW)
   - Location: `/public_html/`
   - Purpose: Specific fix for blood_type column size

#### Documentation Files (OPTIONAL):

8. **`DONOR_STATUS_UPDATE_FIX.md`**
9. **`TRACK_STATUS_FIX.md`**
10. **`QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md`**
11. **`DEPLOYMENT_TO_INFINITY.md`** (this file)

---

### Step 3: Run Database Migration on Production üîß

**IMPORTANT:** After uploading files, you MUST run the migration script on production!

1. In your web browser, visit:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.infinityfreeapp.com/fix_all_donor_issues.php
   ```
   (Replace `yourdomain` with your actual Infinity domain)

2. **Review the output carefully:**
   - ‚úÖ Should show "Fixes Applied" section
   - ‚úÖ Should show table structures
   - ‚úÖ Should say "All fixes complete!"

3. **Take a screenshot** of the results for your records

4. **Common issues and solutions:**
   - **"Table doesn't exist"**: Normal - it will be created
   - **"Column already exists"**: Good - means it's already fixed
   - **"Permission denied"**: Contact Infinity support for database permissions

---

### Step 4: Test Production Site üß™

After running the migration, TEST EVERYTHING:

#### Test 1: Admin Login
- [ ] Can you log into admin panel?
- [ ] Go to: `https://yourdomain.infinityfreeapp.com/admin_enhanced_donor_management.php`

#### Test 2: Update Donor Status
- [ ] Select a donor
- [ ] Click "Update Status"
- [ ] Try changing status to "Served"
- [ ] **Expected:** Success message, no errors ‚úÖ
- [ ] **If error:** Check error message and refer to troubleshooting section

#### Test 3: Track Page
- [ ] Go to: `https://yourdomain.infinityfreeapp.com/track.php`
- [ ] Enter a reference number of an approved donor
- [ ] **Expected:** Shows "Approved" (not "Pending") ‚úÖ

#### Test 4: Database Records
- [ ] Check phpMyAdmin
- [ ] Look at `donations_new` table
- [ ] Verify new donation records are created when marking donors as "Served"

---

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional) üßπ

After confirming everything works:

#### Delete Migration Scripts (Security)

For security, DELETE these files from your production server:

- `fix_all_donor_issues.php`
- `fix_donations_table_column.php`
- `fix_blood_type_column.php`

**Why?** These scripts expose your database structure and should not be publicly accessible.

**Alternative:** Move them to a secure folder outside public_html.

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Permission Denied" Error

**Solution:**
1. Check file permissions (should be 644 for PHP files)
2. Check folder permissions (should be 755)
3. Contact Infinity support if database permissions are restricted

### Issue: "Table already exists" Error

**Solution:**
- This is OK! It means the table is already there
- The script will just update the columns

### Issue: Still Getting "Unknown database error"

**Solution:**
1. Check PHP error logs in cPanel
2. Enable error reporting temporarily:
   ```php
   error_reporting(E_ALL);
   ini_set('display_errors', 1);
   ```
3. Check the specific error message
4. Verify database credentials in `db.php`

### Issue: Track Page Still Shows "Pending"

**Solution:**
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Check if `track.php` was uploaded correctly
3. Verify file permissions (644)
4. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

---

## üìä VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After deployment, verify these items:

- [ ] No errors when updating donor status
- [ ] Donation records are created in `donations_new` table
- [ ] Track page shows correct status for approved donors
- [ ] Track page shows correct status for served donors
- [ ] Email notifications are sent properly
- [ ] Audit log entries are created
- [ ] No PHP errors in error logs

---

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURE (If Something Goes Wrong)

If anything breaks:

### Option 1: Restore Database Backup

1. Go to phpMyAdmin
2. Select your database
3. Click "Import" tab
4. Choose the backup file you saved in Step 1
5. Click "Go"
6. Database will be restored to pre-deployment state

### Option 2: Revert Files

1. Use FTP to delete the new files
2. Re-upload the old versions from your backup
3. Site will return to previous state

---

## üìû SUPPORT

### If You Need Help:

1. **Check error logs** in cPanel (Error Logs section)
2. **Screenshot any errors** you encounter
3. **Note the exact steps** that caused the error
4. **Check the documentation** files (DONOR_STATUS_UPDATE_FIX.md, etc.)

### Infinity-Specific Considerations:

- Free hosting may have execution time limits
- Some DDL operations might be slower
- Database might have restrictions on ALTER TABLE
- If migrations fail, you may need to run SQL commands manually in phpMyAdmin
