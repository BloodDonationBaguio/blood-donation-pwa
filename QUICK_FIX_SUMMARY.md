# Quick Fix Summary - Donor Status Update Error

## What Was Wrong?

You were getting the error: **"There is no active transaction"** when updating donor status.

## What Caused It?

**Two bugs working together:**

1. **Wrong column name**: Code tried to insert into `donation_status` but table had `status`
2. **DDL auto-commit**: `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` statements inside transactions were automatically committing them

## What We Fixed

âœ… Fixed column name mismatch (`donation_status` â†’ `status`)  
âœ… Moved all DDL statements outside transactions  
âœ… Created `ensureAuditLogTableExists()` function to prevent auto-commits  
âœ… Improved error messages  

## What You Need To Do NOW

### Step 1: Run the migration script
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost/blood-donation-pwa/fix_donations_table_column.php
```

This will fix your database table structure if needed.

### Step 2: Test the fix
1. Go to Enhanced Donor Management page
2. Select a donor (ID 63 from your screenshot)
3. Click "Update Status"
4. Change status to any value (try "Served")
5. Click "Update Status"

### Expected Result
âœ… "Donor status updated successfully!" message  
âœ… No errors!  
âœ… Status actually updates  

## If You Still Get Errors

Check these logs:
- `logs/donor_served.log` (in your project folder)
- PHP error logs
- Browser console (F12)

Then share the error message with me.

## Files Changed
- `includes/enhanced_donor_management.php` (fixed column names, transaction handling)
- `includes/admin_actions.php` (separated DDL from transactions)
- `admin_enhanced_donor_management.php` (better error messages)
- `fix_donations_table_column.php` (NEW - migration script)

**Ready to test!** Run the migration script first, then try updating a donor status. ðŸŽ‰
